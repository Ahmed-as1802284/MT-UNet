# MT-UNet

## Update 2021/11/19

- Thank you for your interest in our work. We have uploaded the code of our MTUNet to help peers conduct further research on it. However, rest of the codes (such as the training and testing codes) are currently not so well organized, and we plan to release them upon paper publication. It also should be noted that they are still avaliable right now with a rough appearance. Please contact us for these codes if you are new to this field or having difficulty in applying our model to your own dataset.

The authors of TransUnet did not provide the split of ACDC dataset. Therefore, we conducted all the ACDC experiments based on our own dataset split, and that is why the results may look a little different from the claim of other papers.

This is the official implementation for our ICASSP2022 paper *MIXED TRANSFORMER UNET FOR MEDICAL IMAGE SEGMENTATION*

The entire code will be released upon paper publication.
