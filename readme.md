# MT-UNet

## Update 2022/01/04

We have further trained our MT-UNet and it turns out to have a better result on Synapse with 79.20% DSC. We have changed the pretrained weights of Synapse to this version and will also update the results in our final version of paper.

## Update 2022/01/03

It should be mentioned that we are currently conducting some statistical evaluations on our model and these results will be also made public on this site.

- **[Updated]** Click [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1frQAK05UtiAO8rvKG9y5GXABaH70_-Hu/view?usp=sharing) for the pretrained weights for Synapse. 

- Click [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1DQFNeVbq2GNYhgv0mdTw-7yBTgqUWYBr/view?usp=sharing) for the pretrained weights for ACDC. The authors of TransUnet did not provide the split of ACDC dataset. Therefore, we conducted all the ACDC experiments based on our own dataset split.

## Update 2021/11/19

- Thank you for your interest in our work. We have uploaded the code of our MTUNet to help peers conduct further research on it. However, rest of the codes (such as the training and testing codes) are currently not so well organized, and we plan to release them upon paper publication. It also should be noted that they are still avaliable right now with a rough appearance. Please contact us for these codes if you are new to this field or having difficulty in applying our model to your own dataset.

This is the official implementation for our ICASSP2022 paper *MIXED TRANSFORMER UNET FOR MEDICAL IMAGE SEGMENTATION*

The entire code will be released upon paper publication.
